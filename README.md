# Overview

Turkey, located in the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, is one of the most active earthquake regions in the world. The country, which encounters hundreds of earthquakes a year, has experienced major disasters such as the 1999 Marmara, 2011 Van and 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes. This project aims to reduce earthquake-related damages and prevent both life and economic losses by building more durable structures for Turkey's high seismic risks.

# Project Goals

● Understanding earthquakes and risks by analyzing historical seismic data.
● To develop a reliable earthquake risk map for Türkiye.
● To ensure that precautions are taken against possible earthquakes
● Minimizing loss of life
